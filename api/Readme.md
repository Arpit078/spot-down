similar app to download audio books at port 5000, repo => https://github.com/arpit078/freeaudiobooks
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just paste the playlist url it should download it in 5 minutes. 
The server has very minimal ram so it might not be able to download large playlists though the upper limit is 100 songs. 
Anyways try your luck if it works.



# following recording is when the server is running on a mobile phone using userland.
